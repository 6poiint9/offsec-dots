# Offsec dotfiles ðŸ‘»
Dotfiles for my offensive secuirty environment, using i3 wm. 

Using GNU stow to manage the files. 

# Installation 
Ideally install it on a Kali Linux base installation.
1) **copy** the **contents** of [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/6poiint9/offsec-dots/blob/main/bootsrap.sh)  into any file for example set_up.sh
2) **give** the file **execution** permissions and **run** it:  
    ```sh
    chmod u+x set_up.sh 
    ./set_up.sh 
    ```
3) **log out** and in the lightdm login-screen **choose i3** and log in again
4) Do the **additional steps** noted at the **bottom** of the **script** to finalize the setup
   
   => mainly **link the files** 
   ```sh 
      cd $HOME/.dotfiles 
      stow .
   ``` 
   resolve the possible **errors** by **renaming the file** or running
 
   ```sh 
   stow --adapt . 
   ```
