# Installation 
Ideally install it on a Kali Linux base installation. 
1) copy the contents of bootstrap.sh into any file for example set_up.sh
2) give the file execution permissions and run it:  
    ```sh
    chmod u+x set_up.sh 
    ./set_up.sh 
    ```
3) log out and in the lightdm login-screen choose i3 and log in
4) Do the additional steps noted at the bottom of the script to finalize the setup
